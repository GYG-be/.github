## Git Your GYG Excercises

Try to improve your discipline as much as you can on each of these twelve **exercises** every day. We approach these exercises as if they were a training session in which we are coaching ourselves to get better.  We train with intention now in order to train better in our next training sesssion because time unfolds in our lives to give us a training regimen that is recursive, ie, the point the discipline is working on the discipline of making the discipline better. 

1) Avoid wage slavery; if need $, then sell very small portions of your time thru microwerk, FiveRR; freelance then graduate to StartUpCookbook.US

2) Disrupt dysfunctional affluent cultures which encourage fear and predation -- minimalize consumption, distribute sharing, extend open source and independence 

3) Stop hanging with like-minded people; listen better; flexibilize your mindset for antifragile networking; let needy materialist dead bury their dead 

5) Live in the NOW, using each second of the 86400 second day to think about the coming seconds, each set of seconds makes each subsequent set of seconds better

5) Be more curious about ordinary systems which your life depends upon, eg immune system, cooking/food distribution, gardening, utilities, banks/taxes/regs   

6) Write/edit/revise/re-write more every single day; question unquestioned assumptions to be funnier and thought-provoking for your future self

7) Improve your self-defense, be tougher, less addicted, less fragile ... train in the martial arts hourly, especially flexibilty drills and escaping

8) Dogfood your life by improving the automation and AI to ensure your workflow toolchain is simpler and more effective, then sell your dogfooding

9) Avoid cold calling, begging or asking for a job; make your attractive skills contactable with link pages so that someone can email/DM/calendly you

10) Stop watching tv, sports, netflix, youtube; go for walks -- THINK ... read more broadly, deeply and faster; smartify your RSS newsreader

11) Improve your ideation discipline; entertain yourself by brainstorming ideas from scrolling; categorize ideas into A, B, C, D bins

12) Study how skill economies work; develop intell gathering on talent acquisitions ops; analyze knowledge graph from LinkedIn, Indeed, et al


## GYG Flow -- Git more flow out of GIT

1) Fork Git repositories; dogfood them for your own use; extend them for social development.

2) Understand and use the best practices of using pull requests; develop the culture of sharing

3) Initiate implementation with an issue-driven development process

4) Use ReadTheDocs to document your Pythonic applications as you build them

5) Use/extend Copilot and other AI tools to helpfully suggest code/writing; then extend the AI

6) Use Codespaces and Jupyter Notebooks to practice literate coding and collaboration

7) Use a CI/CD process with GitHub Actions and other automation that improves development quality

8) Write better commit messages, for your own sanity and your own dev discipline; try to use Conventional Commits

9) Change/improve your the fork; add the hard things that you wish someone would add in order to make it your own

10) BE the best selling example of not just your forks, but also your development discipline.

11) Make it more social; find ways to network; consider measuring the effectiveness of your networking
