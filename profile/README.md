## Git Your GYG Excercises

Try to improve your discipline as much as you can on each of these twelve **exercises** every day. We approach these exercises as if they were a training session in which we are coaching ourselves to get better.  We train with intention now in order to train better in our next training sesssion because time unfolds in our lives to give us a training regimen that is recursive, ie, the point the discipline is working on the discipline of making the discipline better. 

1) Manage your own time; avoid wage slavery; if you need $, then get throwaway jobs; try microwerk, such FiveRR; freelance then graduate to StartUpCookbook.US

2) Disrupt dysfunctional affluent cultures which encourage fear and predation -- minimalize consumption, distribute sharing, extend open source and independence 

3) Stop hanging with people who are stuck in the rear-view mirror; listen better, flexibilize your mind, be antifragile; let the dead bury their dead 

5) Live meditatively; return your focuse the NOW, using each second of the 86400 second day with disciplined intention, making the discipline better

5) Be more curious about ordinary systems which your life depends upon, eg immune system, cooking/food distribution, gardening, utilities, banks/taxes/regs   

6) Write/edit/revise/re-write more every single day; question unquestioned assumptions to be funnier and thought-provoking for your future self

7) Improve your self-defense, be tougher, less addicted, less fragile ... train in the martial arts hourly, especially flexibilty drills and escaping

8) Dogfood your life by improving the automation and AI to ensure your workflow toolchain is simpler and more effective, then sell your dogfooding

9) Avoid cold calling, begging or asking for a job; make your attractive skills contactable with link pages so that someone can email/DM/calendly you

10) Stop watching tv, sports, netflix, youtube; go for walks -- THINK ... smartify your investment  by programming your mind with your RSS newsreader

11) Improve your ideation and fulfillment discipline; entertain yourself by brainstorming ideas from scrolling; categorize ideas into A, B, C, D bins
