## 10 steps to Git Your GYG

Improve the discipline a little bit on each step every day ... Life is supposed to be a recursiveAF training regimen ... we train in order to train

1) If you need $, avoid wage slavery ... sell small portions of time; microwerk, FiveRR ... freelance then graduate to StartUpCookbook.US

2) Minimalize your life, use less, share more ... stop being a pathetically target-rich zone for economic predators who eat the needy 

3) Don't hang with like-minded people, especially needy materialists; listen harder, flexibilize your mindset for antifragile networking

4) Understand how things works ... physiology, cooking, gardening, HVAC, sewer drains ... understand how snares catch prey animials

5) Defend yourself, be tougher, less addicted, more physically fit ... train in the martial arts hourly, especially flexibilty drills

6) Dogfood your life by improving the automation and AI, ensure your workflow toolchain is simple and effective, then sell your dogfood

7) Never cold call or beg; instead make your attractive skills contactable with link pages so that someone can email/DM/calendly you

8) Stop watching tv, sports, netflix, youtube; go for walks -- THINK ... read more broadly, deeply and faster; smartify your RSS newsreader

9) Study practical economies; develop intelligence gathering ops on what talents businesses will need; study/analyze data from Indeed, et al

10) Improve your ideation discipline; entertain yourself by brainstorming ideas from scrolling; categorize ideas into A, B, C, D bins
