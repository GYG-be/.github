## Steps to Git Your GYG

Try to improve your discipline as much as you can on each of these twelve exercises every day. We approach these exercises as if they were a training session in which we are coaching ourselves to get better.  We train with intention now in order to train better in our next training sesssion because time unfolds in our lives to give us a training regimen that is recursive, ie, the point the discipline is working on the discipline of making the discipline better. 

1) If you need $, avoid wage slavery; sell very small portions of your time thru microwerk, FiveRR; freelance then graduate to StartUpCookbook.US

2) Minimalize your consumption, use 10X less, share...stop being a pathetically target-rich zone for economic predators who preying on the needy
