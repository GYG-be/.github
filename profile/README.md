## Git Your GYG Excercises

Try to improve your discipline as much as you can on each of these twelve **exercises** every day. We approach these exercises as if they were a training session in which we are coaching ourselves to get better.  We train with intention now in order to train better in our next training sesssion because time unfolds in our lives to give us a training regimen that is recursive, ie, the point the discipline is working on the discipline of making the discipline better. 

1) Avoid wage slavery; if need $, then sell very small portions of your time thru microwerk, FiveRR; freelance then graduate to StartUpCookbook.US

2) Disrupt dysfunctional affluent cultures which encourage fear and predation -- minimalize consumption, distribute sharing, extend open source and independence 

3) Stop hanging with like-minded people; listen better; flexibilize your mindset for antifragile networking; let needy materialist dead bury their dead 

5) Live in the NOW, using each second of the 86400 second day to live forward, working on the discipline of make each subsequent set of seconds better
