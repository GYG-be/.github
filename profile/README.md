## 10 steps to Git Your GYG

Work a little bit on each step every day.

1) If you need money, don't sign up for wage slavery ... sell small portions of time; microwerk, FiveRR ... freelance then graduate to StartUpCookbook.US

2) Minimalize your life, spend less, use less, share more; do not be a pathetically target-rich zone for economic predators who want you needy 

3) STOP hanging out with like-minded people, especially needy materialists; work harder at antifragile networking; flexibilize your mindset

4) Understand how things works ... physiology, cooking, gardening, HVAC, sewer drains ... understand how snares catch prey animials

5) Defend yourself, be tougher, less addicted, more physically fit ... train in the martial arts hourly, especially flexibilty drills

6) Dogfood your life by improving automation, the AI you use and every aspect of your workflow toolchain, then sell skills

7) Never cold call or beg; instead make your attractive skills contactable with link pages so that someone can email/DM/calendly you

8) Stop watching tv, sports, netflix, youtube ... go for walks  ... start reading more and better; use RSS, but smartify your newsreader

9) Study economies; develop intelligence gathering ops on what talent businesses need; study/analyze data from Indeed and other job sites

10) Improve your ideation discipline; entertain yourself by brainstorming ideas from scrolling; categorize ideas into A, B, C, D bins
